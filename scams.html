                <p>Binary trading scams are used to defraud investors of millions of dollars every year. They promise quick returns through the prediction of asset, commodity or index price over a short time period. While there are many licensed firms that trade in them as a legitimate financial services, investment in binary options is high-risk with returns that are almost impossible to predict, even for professionals. This system of investment is often co-opted by scammers.

              <p>Various forms of cryptocurrency fraud exist, ranging from digital heists where hackers pilfer cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum from individuals and prominent cryptocurrency exchanges. A notable instance is the extensive theft of over $32 million from Japan's Bitpoint exchange, reminiscent of the substantial $500 million hacking operation that targeted Coincheck.

                <p>Cryptocurrency investment scams include Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). These are ways that new cryptocurrencies fund their startup by offering new investors the opportunity to receive coin tokens in return for money. While legitimate ICOs do exist for the development of genuine cryptocurrencies, they are also a favourite mechanism used in cryptocurrency fraud.
              </p>
                <P>
                    Many ICOs are marketed without any real technology or legitimate business plans to back them by individuals or small groups with little to no industry or IT experience. In recent years regulatory bodies have prosecuted scam ICO perpetrators. In 2019, the US Securities and Exchange Commission charged the CEO of a software company worth $42million, for defrauding investors through an ICO.

                <p>Malware is a catch-all term for software designed to damage or exploit a digital device, network or operating system, usually for the cybercriminal’s financial gain. Our meticulous malware investigations can tackle any type, including the most common forms below.
              </p>
               
              <p>
                Viruses
                <br><br>
This malware comes as an email attachment that contains a virus payload, which carries out the malicious action. When the victim opens the file, their device gets infected.
<br><br>
Ransomware
<br>
<br>
Ransomware installs itself onto a victim’s device and then encrypts its files, obstructing your access until they pay the culprit a specified sum of money. 
<br><br>
Worms
<br><br>
Worms replicate from machine to machine with no need for user interaction. Rather, they exploit a weak link in a software or operating system’s security to spread on their own.
<br><br>
Scareware
<br><br>
These programs instil fear through alarming messages online. This tactic pressures the victim into purchasing a fraudulent application as protection, which is the actual malware.
<br><br>
Spyware
<br><br>
Installed on a victim’s device without their knowledge, spyware transmits personal details, communications and browsing behaviours to its user, who can monitor activities remotely.
<br><br>
Adware
<br><br>
These programs bombard users with unwanted ads that blink or block a particular action. They tend to be installed in return for something, like unpaid access to an online service.
<br><br>
Trojans
<br><br>
Trojans pose as safe applications, swindling unsuspecting users into downloading them. Once launched, they then can steal data, crash systems, spy on operations and more.
<br><br>
Fileless malware
<br><br>
This code works within a computer’s memory instead of the hard drive. As it doesn’t depend on files and leaves no malicious trace, it can be difficult to identify and tackle.

                <p>Dating scams play on your emotions with the aim of persuading you to provide money, gifts or personal information. You may be approached on dating websites or via social media before the scammer works to move communications to more private and less regulated channels like text or email.
              </p>
              <p>
                Your ‘love interest’ will pursue a seemingly strong connection with you, despite plans to meet in person never materialising. Once they have secured your trust, they will ask you to send money for things like healthcare fees, travel costs or investment opportunities. In reality, they will either pocket these funds and/or use your bank account for further fraudulent activity.
              </p>
              <p>Often run by international crime syndicates, online dating scams can also pose a serious danger to your personal safety. You may be lured abroad and tangled up in perilous situations with devastating consequences. Don’t take the risk.</p>
